          <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong><br>
          The core learning encourages us to reflect on ourselves and our self talk. Changing your perspective can alter your performance in a positive way. 
          I have become more aware through the core learning on where I have a fixed mindset and how this is detrimental to my learning. For example I thought I was always a slow learner,
          however that can only be in reference to other people and comparing yourself to others usually results in feeling disheartened. 
          I now focus on comparing myself on where I have come from and using my "why" as a point of reference to foster positive self talk when I am outside my comfort zone. <br>
          <br><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
          I feel the role of values, empathy and self-awareness play very important and influential role in an environment where you are learning a new language on a platform with others who are also 
          learning a new language and we are potentially all to varying degrees, outside our comfort zones. Compassion is super important as we each come from different backgrounds and 
          you never know what is going on for that person you are interacting with. Also 70% of our communicatioin comes from body language which is hard to gauge when you are online, so its even more important to 
          be aware, be kind and encourage others, never belittle them. 
          If you are clear about your values you can also use that to meet your needs in an environment where you have very little time. Knowing what fills you up and how to self care when you are constantly being 
          challenged and are outside your comfort zone will help you deal with these challenges more effectively. <br>
          <br><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
          I find it surprising and interesting to see how much my values and attitudes have changed over time. To reflect on where my values are now and question whether my actions and lifestyle are reflecting 
          my values or if I am holding onto values I no longer align with. I am also surprised at the amount of research and development on human efficacy there is and how important it is to keep up with new findings<br>
          <br><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
          I feel the most challenging aspect of core is the level of responsibility placed back onto you, which is a good thing and a scary thing I guess. 
          You now have the power to reflect on where you have a fixed mindset, lack emotional intellegence or have something thats not working for you in both your learning and in your life and apply the ethos of 
          core learning to it to solve problems in a new way.<br>
          <br><strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong><br>
          I know that the core cirruculum was designed as a result of industry specific feedback and I see how important it is in facilitating learning a large amount of material in a short amount of time. 
          It helps you deal with being outside of your comfort zone, managing problems, communicating with others and working well in a team.
          If you could just create a function makeABetterMoreOnToItHuman () {} and inserted that into the code of all humans that would be pretty cool, but you can't actually do that I don't think, so learning about the human core skills is the next best thing I guess.  <br>
          <br><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time 
          to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
          Learning the core ciriculum is fun and helps you deal with the challenges of learning programming. If I wasn't taught about neuroplasticity and growth mindset I perhaps would have thrown my computer out the window by now. Jokes aside I find the core ciriculum 
          a welcome respite from the frustration of learning to understand computer code. It helps me to be more patient with myself and others and to use science based research to make the most of my time and my actions <br>
