        <p class="sky-para">
          <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong><br>
          I would like to be a UX designer, but I'm flexible to go in an organic direction as I learn more about where my strengths are.<br>
          <br><strong>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:</strong><br>
          I am a systems thinker and take a while to learn something but once I get going I really sink my teeth in.<br>
          <br><strong>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong><br>
          Leadership and facilitation.<br>
          <br><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives. 
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</strong><br>
          I'm commited to being positive, professional and making a contribution. When things build up I will go back to basics. Take breaks from the computer, brain dump on paper and seek help if required.
           I think stepping back to step up is nessesary and I feel using some light hearted humour is key to dealing with stress<br>
          <br><strong>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong><br>
          I hope the facilitation team will provide feedback and encourage me along the way, identifying my strengths and weaknesses and challenging me to level up.<br>
          <br><strong>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</strong><br>
          I'm pretty flexible with my time. I am dedicated to regular exercise and creativity<br>
