<h1>Emotional Intellegence</h1>
<div class="sky-para">
  <p>Emotional Intellegence is the ability to be aware of your emotions, manage, control 
  and evaluate emotions, disern where they come from and how they affect your body and being. 
  Emotional Intellegence has been given increasing importance since leadership research has 
  identified it as a causal factor in performance, success and positive well being.<br>
  <br>Daniel Goldman is the leading authority on Emotional Intellegence and explains the 4 domains of emotional intellegence as:
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Self Awareness:</strong>Understanding your feelings and having a "gutt sense" of circumstances. 
  Being able to apply an ethical navigation to your decision making because you have the ability to identify and deconstruct your emotions</li>
  <li><strong>Self Management:</strong>How we handle our emotions. We need to be adaptable and 
  flexible and this comes from our internal self management. Being able to label your emotioins creates distance and helps us reduce related stress and anxiety.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Awareness:</strong>This is also known as empathy. How we identify and understand the emotions of others? How can we support them? 
  How can we help them to support themselves?</li>
  <li><strong>Relationship Management:</strong>How we manage relationships. Can we inspire and motivate others? Can we speak to peoples hearts.
  Can we lead by example and be a great team player? How are our negotiation and collaboration skills?</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><strong>So...What helps with Emotional Intellegence?</strong></h2>
  <ul id="list">
  <li>The ability to recognise your emotions: What am I feeling? When did this begin? What caused this emotion? 
  When in the past have I felt this emotion? How are they affecting me in my body?</li>
  <li>Write your emotions down: This helps to acknowledge, analyse, accept and appreciate your emotions. Reflect on their origin</li>
  <li>Learning new concepts: Learn a new language, try new challenging activities, drive a new way to work. This helps develop new neural pathways and connections
  in the brain</li>
  <li>Self-care practice: Meditation, walking, hygiene and healthy social connection can help to decrease ruminating thoughts and patterns</li>
  <li>Gratitude: Actively practicing meaningful gratitude has shown to increase well-being and emotional regulation</li>
  <li>Handle the emotions of others: How can you support and educate others and feel empathy and understanding?</li>
  </ul>
