        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvT5XS7j-Dc"><Beau Miles></a>This might not seem completely relevant, but bare with me beacause 
        Beau is setting a fine example of creating neural pathways. He is using practise and muscle memory to strengthen a habit, he is connecting other tasks
        to his pre-existing habit, using it as an anchor to create new positive habits and solving problems by being task orientated, while still being flexible and creating new tasks and tangents.

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p> 
       <ul>
          <li>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</li>
            In growth mindset success is determined by learning and honing skills. The belief that you can improve, grow and change.
          <li>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
            The fine tuning of growth mindset in areas that have been taken for granted 
            such as healthy eating. Also be patient and remind yourself, mindset takes a lifetime to form so takes time to change it too.
          <li>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
            Create a small mantra about mindset and practice! Also link new learning to context
        </ul>
