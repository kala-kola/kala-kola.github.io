    <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

      <ul id="list">
        <li><strong>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</strong></li>
        Neuroplasticity is not fixed like neurologists previously beleived. We can influence our neural pathways and rewire our brain connections
        though our thoughts, lifestyle and environment. When people understand this they gain greater motivation
        to take actions which improve neural pathways. In other words, people believe they have the power to learn, change and grow. Control and responsibility are back in their hands.
        <br>
        <br>
      	<li><strong>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</strong></li>
        Once we understand the mechanisms of neuroplasticity we can create new habits that will strengthen neural pathways for our benefit. <br>
        According to Kristen Meisenheimer in her TedX speech 'Rewiring Revolution', rewiring connections happens on 3 levels. <br>Firstly, chemical; neurotransmitters like seratonine and dopamine. 
        <br>Secondly, Structural level, involving the growth of new connections between neurons. <br>Thirdly, the functional level where connections are more easily activated through repeating use.<br>
        That seems very science based so what are the implications? <br>Well, to rewire connections we can do so in different ways. <br>The first level is chemical so by creating a reward system after doing a difficult task 
        releasing dopamine which helps us remember the task more easily.<br> We can use the structural level by creating new experiences or associating new learning with existing connections. Giving learning content context 
        usually helps with associating connections. <br>Finally, the functional level means connections are strengthened through repeated use. <br>Practice, Practice, Practice make neural pathways!
        <br>
        <br>
        <li><strong>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</strong></li>
        Neuroplasticity is influenced by a combination of our thoughts, environment and lifestyle.<br>
        <strong>Thoughts:</strong><br>
        Be here now. People have shown to be less happy when their minds wander. Observing your thoughts is a powerful practice and leads to many benefits including more easily being able to 
        respond rather than react to negative or triggering situations. If you become aware of negative neural pathways like reacting to an emotional triggers you can relax in the situation and not react. This will create a new neural pathway.
        Kristen Meisenheimer suggests; When the mind wanders, lable that thought as "thinking"<br>
        Visualisation is another way in which using your thoughts can improve neural pathways. Imagining an action and doing it require the same motor
        and sensory programs in the brain! Imagination and action are actually intergrated and involve the same neural pathways so practicing one actually influences the other. 
        <br>
        <strong> Lifestyle and environment:</strong><br>
        The Dunedin study, a first class longitudinal study of the health, development and well-being of about 1000 participants over
        40 years of their lives, found there was a correlation between cardiovascular fitness and brain structure, further infering
        cardiovascular fitness (measured by walking speed) may actually influence brain structure.<br>
        They also showed childhood self-control had positive influence on development throughout life and that brain structure and the speed of aging 
        of a persons brain corresponds to their speed of aging in general.<br>
        So maintaining healthy eating, sleeping, exercise and positive mental health and social connection, those things associated with life 
        longevity also have positive influence on brain structure<br>

      <br>
      This might not seem completely relevant, but bare with me because 
      Beau is setting a fine example of creating neural pathways. He is a preexisting pathway, running and is connecting other tasks
      to his pre-existing habit, using it as an anchor to create new positive habits and solving problems by being task orientated, while still being flexible and creating new tasks and tangents.

    <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p> 
       <ul id="list">
          <li><Strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</Strong></li>
            Fixed mindset is the mindset that your learning ability (or any other characteristic or attribute) is pre-determined or fixed. 
            Growth mindset is the mindset that you have influence over your intellegence by learning and honing skills. The belief that you can improve, grow and change.
            <br>
          <li><Strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</Strong></li>
          It made me think about fine tuning to a growth mindset in areas that have been taken for granted or I have strong patterns with
          such as my career, where I live and aspects of my lifestyle. Also be patient and remind yourself, mindset takes a lifetime to form so takes time to change it too.
            <br>
          <li><Strong>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</Strong></li>
          Create a small mantra about mindset and practice! Also link new learning to context
          Positive self talk regarding my process such as effort, strategy, focus, perseverance and improvement rather than intelligence.
