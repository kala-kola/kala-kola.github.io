        <h1>Identity and Values</h1>
        <p class="sky-para">
      <strong>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values 
      involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</strong><br>
      When I was 16 I decided to never eat McDonalds Again, this evolved into an anti global-monopolisation philosophy
       I still strongly adhere to today, with the exception of buying some technical items like my Macbook! But generally 
       I prefer to support local, decentralised movements<br>
      <br><strong>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</strong><br>
      My Dad always recited a poem to my brother and I: <br>
      <em>If you think you will you've won, <br>For out in the world we find<br>
      Success begins with a fellows will, <br>It's all in the state of mind<br>
      Lifes battles don't always go to the stronger or faster man<br>
      In the end the man that wins is the one who thinks he can</em><br>
      This poem reminds us persistence is key and echos As a man thinketh by James Allen <br>
      <br><strong>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</strong><br>
      I am an outside the box thinker, creative and studious.... also a bit silly.<br>
      <br><strong>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.<br> How might these
      affect your learning journey?</strong><br>
      Sometimes I focus too much on the details and trying to be perfect when really I just need to start!<br> Then keep going<br>
      <br><strong>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance
      or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections
      on what other strategies you would try now and why.</strong><br>
      In my previous position I felt I wanted things to change quickly and held high expectations for people.
      I needed to show more patience and step back and enjoy the process more. Wu wei has a lot of wisdom in it!
      Through my experience I have learnt that allowing is more powerful than forcing or pushing.
      You still show up and put the yards in, just do it with less attachment or force. 
      Its the people and relationships you have that matter. Also having well defined boundaries
      is somethinhg super important.
