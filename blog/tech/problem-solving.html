    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <p>
      <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
      <br>
      1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
      <br>
      <ul id="list">
      <li>What was the problem?</li>
      <br>
      Gradebook problem really stumped me at every single phase!
      <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
      I tried endlessly guessing, researched methods and thought 
      I had to map an array through a function and return via a for loop, I asked for help and 
      found this solution was much more simple. A plain and humble dot.
      <li>how did you feel throughout the process?</li>
      <br>
      broken
      <li>What did you learn?</li>
      That the solution was probably something simple like you initially expected, and the importance of breaking things down
      </ul>

      <h2>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h2>
      <br>
      <ul id="list">
        <li>What was the problem?</li>
        Finally in my built in Methods Kata I got the deeBee test smoothly
        <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
        I watched all the tutorial videos, took meticulous notes and broke down the problem using Pseudocode
        <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
        I thought, finally, I can do the thing now....
        <li>What did you learn?</li>
        Use all the resourses available to you, use the hints, watch the videos, take good notes. Keep it simple.
        </ul>

      <h2>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
        <ul id="list">
          <li>Pseudocode</li>
          I love Pseudocode and use it often. 
          <li>Trying something</li>
          Just randomly trying something usually means I'm taking a stab in the dark and I need to time out and take a more methodical approach
          <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
          I don't have a rubber ducky but I talk out loud sometimes and... this actually helps, luckily I live in a sleepout and there is less danger of people thinking I'm crazy
          <li>Reading error messages</li>
          Sometimes I feel this works and I'm condident, however sometimes I feel this is difficult
          <li>Console.logging</li>
          This is a useful method, It shows you what is happening to you can check if its what you think is happening
          <li>Googling</li>
          Number 1! Warning this will also send me down a JS rabbit hole and I might get distracted, also you have to know what to google
          <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
          I have done that during this week
          <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
          I have done that a lot this week
          <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
          This is an excellent technique because you can see patterns of getting stuck and find solutions. One pattern I found was that I would over 
          complicate things, so it's helpful for me to take the time to be sure what the required code actually is
        </ul>
