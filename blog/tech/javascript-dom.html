            <h2>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2><br>
            <p>
              Say you want to go to California and travel by airplane, well the airplane is the HTML, its wings the nuts and bolts, wheels, engine etc.... all similar to HTML of a website, the actual structure.
              Now what company do you want to fly with... is it Air New Zealand, Fiji Airways or United airlines? Each have a different color and layout of the airplanes with different branding and a different terminal at the airport.
              This is similar to CSS, the style of a website, its colouring, branding, layout and the feel of the site are all actioned by CSS.<br>
              Great.... we have chosen our flight and the airline brand we are going with! Lets go! Not so fast there! you wouldn't get on a plane with no pilot or stewards would you? Javascript is like the pilot and their crew, some 
              handlers put your baggage on the plane, the host will close the door and make sure you are safe in emergency and the pilot will actually fly the plane, turn on those engines, take off and move the plane to the desired destination.
            </p>
            <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).</h2>
            <p><strong>Control flow</strong> is the order in which the computer follows instructions. Say we are doing a work out and want to do push ups, squats and mountain climbers.
            Code is run from the first line to the last line, so we would do a push up, one squat and one mountain climber. But what if it was leg day and we want to do more mountain climbers than squats and more squats than push ups? We would need a conditional statement 
            that changes the control flow.<br>
            A <strong>Loop</strong> would change the control flow and let us do more mountain climbers than push ups. A loop has 3 parts; an iterator start point,
            a condition dictating how many times we will go through the loop and an instruction about what we do when we finish the loop eg increase the iterator.
            
            </p>

            <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
            <p>The DOM stands for document Object model. With the DOM Javascript (JS) can create dynamic HTML, JS can change HTML elements and attributes including adding and 
              removing new elements and attributes. JS can change CSS styles, react to HTML events and create new events.<br>
              <img src="/images/dom-tree.png" alt="Dom node tree" width="60%"> <br> 
              Think of the DOM as a family tree with a main trunk, known as HTML and 2 major arteries known as the head and the body. Off each of these is several other nodes each with their own children nodes. 
              The parent and child relationship is important as attributes of the parent are inheritted in the child, but don't worry we have good old DNA splicing Javascript to change the attributes of child and parent. 

            </p>

            <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
            <p>
              Arrays are like a sorted list you can keep things in but if you wanted to store more than one attribute for that thing, you would turn that thing into an object. 
              For example, I have a shopping list with Weetbix, Marmite and bread. This would be an array, however if I wanted to say a bit more like 1kg box of weetbix, 
              Marmite 500g and 2 loaves of vogels bread I would need to turn each item on my list into an object.<br>
              Arrays remember the order of the list but objects don't. You could put an object inside an array and an array inside an object and if you did this you would be making data structures... look at you go.
            </p>
            <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
            <p>
                Functions are the backbone of Javascript. A function is an instruction or a little set of instructions which you can give a code name and use that name where you want to.
                Functions always have 2 parts: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>declaring (defining the function)</li><br>
                    <li>calling the function (setting it to action)</li>
                </ol> <br>
                Parameters are variables you can place inside brackets, they are used like the n character in maths.
                <img src="/images/function-eg.png" alt="image of code" width="60%"> <br>
                Here we see the function called loud being declared with the parameter of words.
                Inside the function goes the arguments, they are the real values passed to the function. 
                If a function is called with missing arguments, the missing values by default are set to undefined
